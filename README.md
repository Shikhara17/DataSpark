# DataSpark

## Introduction
**DataSpark** is a robust data engineering project designed to handle and process large datasets with high efficiency and scalability. Using Python and Apache Spark, along with a suite of other technologies, this project aims to streamline data workflows in environments that demand high-throughput data operations.

## Key Features
- **Large Dataset Processing**: Optimized for handling and processing vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) to scale resources dynamically according to the workload demands.
- **Versatile Data Handling**: Supports various data formats including JSON, XML, and others, ensuring flexibility across different data pipelines.

## Tech Stack
- **PySpark**: For large-scale data processing.
- **AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR)**: Manages cluster scaling and data processing tasks in the cloud.
- **AWS S3**: Used for data storage and integration with other AWS services.
- **HDFS**: For distributed storage to enhance data access speed in Spark jobs.
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery for developing interactive web interfaces.
- **Data Interchange Formats**: JSON, XML for data manipulation and storage.
- **DevOps and Management Tools**: SWAGGER, GIT, Jira, Control M, Docker, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Agile Development practices.
- **CI/CD**: Integrated continuous integration and deployment practices to streamline updates and maintain system integrity.
